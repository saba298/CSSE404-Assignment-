## Reliability Metrics

1. **AVAIL (Availability)**: Target 99.9% uptime during semester registration times.
   - Justification: Timeliness of student registration depends on high availability.

2. **ROCOF (Rate of Failure Occurrence)**: No more than 1 error per 1,000 registration transactions.
   - Justification: Ensures operational dependability during mass concurrent user sessions.

These metrics are consistent with fundamental dependability concerns, which are emphasised in dependable system specifications.
