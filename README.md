This Online University Course Registration System enables university students to register for their courses online, manage their schedules, and view academic records. It includes modules for login, course catalog browsing, seat availability checking, and registration submission.

Security & Dependability Justification:
The system handles private and sensitive academic data and requires protection against unauthorized access and data manipulation. High availability is also important to support peak registration periods.

The development follows Agile principles such as continuous delivery and stakeholder collaboration to ensure the system evolves based on student feedback.
